For example, zSnout has many subsites for different purposes whereas most websites have one main purpose, it uses a different theming system that other websites, and it was designed from the ground up to work as an app. I think that\u2019s pretty cool, and I want to explore it more!</p><nav class="table-of-contents"><ul><li><a href="#zsnout-serves-multiple-purposes">zSnout Serves Multiple Purposes</a></li><li><a href="#a-different-theming-system">A Different Theming System</a></li><li><a href="#it%E2%80%99s-an-app%3F">It\u2019s An App?</a></li><li><a href="#all-code-is-open-source">All Code is Open Source</a></li></ul></nav><h2 id="zsnout-serves-multiple-purposes" tabindex="-1">zSnout Serves Multiple Purposes</h2><p>One of the things I\u2019ve seen with almost every other website (and most pieces of software) is that they have a singular purpose. For example, Google Docs is dedicated to providing a good writing experience, Khan Academy aims to teach people different things, and YouTube is good at connecting people with videos they\u2019ll enjoy. On the other hand, zSnout has lots of different content, as you can tell from spending over three seconds on the homepage. One reason for this is that it\u2019s mostly a hobby of mine because I like coding and I thought it would be fun to have a website where I could present my code to other people.</p><h2 id="a-different-theming-system" tabindex="-1">A Different Theming System</h2><p>Another reason I notice that zSnout\u2019s different is in our theming system. Most sites I\u2019ve seen either use a white theme with an accent color or have a seperate theme for when the user\u2019s in dark mode. On zSnout, we default you to using the dark theme and allow you to choose which theme you want. Additionally, our \u201Cdark\u201D theme is mostly aqua because it\u2019s my favorite color and I like to feature it prominently in things I make, whereas most websites use a strictly black theme for \u201Cdark mode\u201D.</p><h2 id="it%E2%80%99s-an-app%3F" tabindex="-1">It\u2019s An App?</h2><p>To tell you the truth, I\u2019m surprised at how few websites make themselves offline-capable. With modern web technologies it\u2019s super easy to store pages for later use. For example, try disabling your internet connection and reloading this page. It\u2019ll still work because it\u2019s stored locally on your device. In fact, any page you\u2019ve visited recently will be stored on your device. You can also install zSnout locally to your device as an application.</p><h2 id="all-code-is-open-source" tabindex="-1">All Code is Open Source</h2><p>Another thing that makes zSnout different is that ALL of the code used in the website is publicly available for download as <a href="https://github.com/zsnout/zsnout.com">https://github.com/zsnout/zsnout.com</a>. Because of this, it allows anybody to submit an issue, bug report, or feature request. Other people can even contribute code to zSnout, so long as they pass our security checks and manual reviews.</p><hr><p>In conclusion, I think that zSnout is a very different website than most, but it\u2019s still a great site and has been a fun project for me to work on. I hope to create something amazing that people will enjoy, and I hope to see more people use zSnout in the future. Thanks!</p><p><em>This article includes opinions from Zachary Sakowitz and does not reflect the opinions of zSnout as a whole.</em></p></div>',1),i=[n],r={},d="",c=t({__name:"WhatMakesZSnoutDifferentView",setup(u,{expose:e}){return e({frontmatter:{},excerpt:void 0}),(h,l)=>(o(),s("article",{frontmatter:r},i))}});export{c as default,d as excerpt,r as frontmatter};
