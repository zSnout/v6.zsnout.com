## Overview

This method uses codes that we add up to get to our final result.

## Calculate It!

As we explain the process, we'll use **December 16, 2482** as an example.

1. Take the last two digits of the year. In our example, this is $82$.
2. Divide by 4, and drop any remainder. For us,
   $\lfloor 82 \div 4 \rfloor = 20$.
3. Add the date of the month. We'll do $20 + 16 = 36$.
4. Add the month's value from the [month codes table](#month-codes). In our
   example, this is $6$, so we do $36 + 6 = 42$.
5. Add the century code from the [century codes table](#century-codes). In our
   example, this is $6$, so we do $42 + 6 = 48$.
6. Add the last two digits of the year. In our example, this was $82$, so we do
   $48 + 82 = 130$.
7. Divide by 7 and take the remainder. In our example, this is
   $130 \bmod 7 = 4$.
8. Find your day in the [day codes table](#day-codes). In our example, this is
   Wednesday. This is your final result!
